# Home Assistant role

This role deploys Home Assistant as one Docker Compose service on the application's own
cloud-init Debian VM. USB passthrough is optional; an empty `app.usb_mapping` omits both the
Proxmox attachment and the Compose device binding. When configured, the named Proxmox USB
mapping must be declared dedicated and the guest device path must name its serial node.

Integration credentials are read from the hidden `integration_credentials` JSON field in
`homelab-infra/apps/<instance>` and rendered to a root-only `secrets.yaml`. They are never
accepted in `config/apps/<instance>.yml` or printed by Ansible.
